# Milestone 18 Constriction Upstream Edge Balance Diagnostic

Schema: `raftsim.milestone18.constriction_upstream_edge_balance.v0`

Decision: **BLOCKED**

Scenario: `constriction_seed_16`
Face-state width/depth report: `physics/reports/milestone18/constriction_upstream_edge_source_balance_final_support_face_state_width_depth.json`
Face/source audit report: `physics/reports/milestone18/constriction_upstream_edge_source_balance_final_support_face_source_audit.json`
Diagnostic scope: Joins constriction upstream edge face-state width/depth samples with reconstructed face/source balance and native C++ post-source audit rows before the next solver retune.

## Summary

- Target samples: `0`
- Blocked targets: `0`
- Width/depth coupled blockers: `0`
- Source-balance blockers: `0`
- Native post-source sign mismatches: `0`
- Paired-edge opposition mismatches: `0`
- Max abs volume-flux delta: `0` m3/s
- Max abs balance delta: `0` m3/s2

## Target Samples

| Face | Column | Rows | GeoClaw q/sign | C++ q/sign | q delta | Balance delta | Width/depth deltas | Native C++ post q/sign | Native delta | Lever |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- | --- | ---: | ---: | --- | --- | ---: | --- |

## Paired Edge Summary

| Column | Lower signs | Upper signs | GeoClaw opposed | C++ opposed | Match |
| ---: | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 9 | `1->1` | `-1->-1` | `True` | `True` | `True` |
| 8 | `1->1` | `-1->-1` | `True` | `True` | `True` |
| 5 | `1->1` | `-1->-1` | `True` | `True` | `True` |
| 3 | `1->1` | `-1->-1` | `True` | `True` | `True` |
| 0 | `1->1` | `-1->-1` | `True` | `True` | `True` |
| 1 | `1->1` | `-1->-1` | `True` | `True` | `True` |
| 2 | `1->1` | `-1->-1` | `True` | `True` | `True` |
| 7 | `1->1` | `-1->-1` | `True` | `True` | `True` |
| 6 | `1->1` | `-1->-1` | `True` | `True` | `True` |
| 4 | `1->1` | `-1->-1` | `True` | `True` | `True` |

## Blocked Reasons

- No upstream edge balance targets were available from the focused constriction reports.

## Next Levers

- Regenerate the constriction face-state and face/source reports before the next solver retune.
