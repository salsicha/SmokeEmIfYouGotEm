# Unreal Photoreal Open-World Stack

The first Unreal slice targets UE 5.8 and enables the modern photoreal river-corridor stack in source-controlled project configuration.
Landscape, rocks, banks, and foliage are treated as first-class immersion targets, with each river corridor pushed as close to photorealistic reference quality as target hardware, VR comfort, and gameplay readability allow.

## Production Baseline

- Nanite for rocks, canyon walls, terrain detail meshes, raft parts, scanned props, and debris.
- Lumen/Lumen Lite evaluation for canyon bounce lighting, wet-rock reflections, forest shade, weather, and portable performance modes.
- Virtual Shadow Maps for dense foliage and dynamic raft/crew shadows.
- World Partition for real-world river corridors.
- PCG for foliage, rocks, gravel bars, driftwood, debris, foam-line accents, and hazards.
- Niagara for white water spray, mist, splash, foam, rain, paddle effects, and rescue cues.
- Substrate/material-layering workflows for wet rock, rubber, mud, foam, helmets, PFDs, and aerated water.
- OpenXR for VR.

## Evaluation Only

- Mesh Terrain, Procedural Vegetation Editor, Fast Geometry Streaming, and Nanite foliage remain feature-evaluation items until they pass editor, performance, memory, and VR comfort checks.
- Unreal Water System is enabled for visual water and authoring, but the custom shallow-water solver remains authoritative physics.

The canonical feature manifest is `unreal/Content/RaftSim/Rendering/photoreal_stack.manifest.json`.

The first vertical-slice environment recipe is `unreal/Content/RaftSim/Rendering/vertical_slice_environment_corridor.json`. It binds the South Fork corridor package, photoreal stack, and telemetry presentation cues into map-authoring layers for landscape/bed, banks, rocks, foliage, debris/access context, lighting/weather, audio occlusion/reverb geometry, and water-readability support.

The three-river environment source and capture plan is `unreal/Content/RaftSim/Rendering/photoreal_river_environment_sources.json`. It records the source stack for South Fork American, Colorado River, and Pacuare: maps, terrain, hydrography, flow evidence, aerial/satellite imagery, link-only social/reference media policy, procedural generation layers, target Unreal map packages, and required guide-seat downstream captures.

The first generated preview maps are now available under `/Game/RaftSim/Maps/EnvironmentPreviews/`, and rendered procedural blockout captures are written to `docs/environment-captures/photoreal_river_previews/` by the `RaftSim.CreatePhotorealEnvironmentPreviewMaps` and `RaftSim.CapturePhotorealEnvironmentPreviews` editor automation. These are source-aware development previews with generated valley terrain, curved river ribbons, foam/hydraulic cue strips, boulder bars, foliage proxies, and per-river light/fog variants; final photoreal approval still requires reviewed DEM/aerial inputs and rights-cleared or first-party assets.

The recipe requires guide-seat review captures, desktop/VR/debug quality budgets, source and rights manifests, and replay alignment between rendered water features and solver/runtime telemetry before the environment can count as milestone-complete.
